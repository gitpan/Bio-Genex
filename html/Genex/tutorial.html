<H1>Tutorial for Genex.pm</H1>
<P>This is an ever expanding tutorial on the use of the Genex.pm
module. If you have suggestions for improving this content, please
mail the author.
</P>

<H1>Overview</H1>

<P>
Genx is distributed with an Application Programmer's Interface (API)
written in Perl and distributed under the perl package, Genex.pm. The
API was built with a one class per table approach, so that each table
in the database (DB) is represented by a single perl class in the
'Genex' namespace (listed in table 1). A large subset of the classes
represent the Genex controlled vocabulary tables--each of which
regulates the accepted values of a single column for a single table
(listed in table 2).  Lastly, there are three utility modules (listed
in table 3) for help with common data access and data conversion
tasks.
</P>
<P>
A common task would be to investigate the data in a single row in a DB
table, for example the ExperimentSet table. To accomplish this we
would create a Bio::Genex::ExperimentSet instance and set it's 'id'
attribute to the value desired:
<P>

<PRE>
$exp_set =  Bio::Genex::ExperimentSet->new(id=>$pkey); 
</PRE>

<P>
Now that we have the object we can access the data stored in that row
of the DB by simply using accessor methods on the object. Each method
has the same name as the DB column it accesses:
</P>
<PRE>
$bio_desc = $exp_set->biology_description();
$rel_date = $exp_set->release_date();
</PRE>
<P>
For situtations were it is necessary to fetch multiple rows from the
DB, each class provides a get_object() method that can be utilized in
three modes: 1) passing a list of primary key values to fetch; 2)
passing the keyword 'ALL', to retrieve all entries from the table, and
3) specifying a column and value to use for restricting the objects:
</P>
<PRE>
@exp_sets1 = Bio::Genex::ExperimentSet->get_objects(4,7,21); 
@exp_sets2 = Bio::Genex::ExperimentSet->get_objects('ALL'); 
@exp_sets3 = Bio::Genex::ExperimentSet->get_objects({column=>'is_public',
                                                value=>1}); 
</PRE>

<H2>More Complex Queries</H2>
<P>
This interface works well for simple DB queries, but many applications
need access to a richer set of DB commands. Genex is designed so that
it can be implemented on top of many different database management
systems (DBMSs). So far it has been tested on Sybase and
PostgreSQL. One problem with this approach is the heterogenious nature
of the Structured Query Lanquage (SQL) accross differrent DBMSs. To
handle this problem, a simple SQL wrapper layer is provided by the
Bio::Genex::DBUtils module for creating SQL for DB inserts and selects:
</P>
<PRE>
$dbh = Bio::Genex::current_connection(); # get a DB handle
$sql = create_insert_sql($dbh,
                         TABLE=>'Contact',
                         COLUMNS=>['contact_person','url']);
$sth = $dbh->prepare($sql);
$sth->execute('Patrick O. Brown','http://www.stanford.edu/')

$sql = create_select_sql($dbh,
                         COLUMNS=>['name'],
                         FROM=>['ArrayMeasurement'],
                         WHERE=>"am_pk = 34");
@arrays = $dbh->selectall_array($sql);
</PRE>
<P>
The Bio::Genex::current_connection() function provides a cached DB handle
to the default Genex DB that was specified during installation. This
makes it simple to change the location and name of the DB and not have
to modify any of the applications built to access it.
</P>

<H2>Writing Output as XML or HTML</H2>
<P>
One of the primary uses of the Genex DB is as a data repository that
users around the world can use to retrieve information. We have
written an XML based exchanged format, the Genex Expression Markup
Language (GEML), as the medium of data transmission. To facilitate
data input and output from XML, we have included an XMLUtils module.
</P>
<P>
Another important use is to display the contents of data in the DB to
the users, and since the WWW browser has become the de facto standard
for information retrieval and browsing we have included an HTMLUtils
module to render Genex objects as HTML.
</P>

<H2>CGI Example</H2>
<P>
To provide a final concrete example for using the Genex modules we
will build a simple perl CGI script that will enable browsing of any
DB table, displaying either a single entry from a table or all
entries:
</P>
<PRE>
use Bio::Genex;
use Bio::Genex::HTMLUtils qw(objs2html);

# start a DB connection
$dbh = Bio::Genex::current_connection();

# start the HTML page and get the DB accession number from the script
$query = new CGI;
$pkey = param('AccessionNumber');
$table = param('Table');

# start the output
print $query->header, $query->h2("$table Entries Retrieved from GeneX");
print $query->p("Your query returned " . scalar @objects . " $table entries");

# import the namespace for this class, and retrieve the objects
$class = 'Bio::Genex::' . $table;
eval "require $class";
if ($pkey eq 'ALL') {
  push(@objects, $class->get_objects('ALL'));
} else {
  push(@objects, $class->new(id=>$pkey));
}

# make the table, and end the page
$html = objs2table(HEADER=>1,CGI=>$query,OBJECTS=>\@objects);
print $query->table({-border=>''},$html), $query->end_html;
</PRE>
<P>
An example of the output of this script is shown in Figure 1.

<H2>More Details</H2>
<P>
Each module has accompanying documentation in both Perl pod format
(Plain Old Documentation) and HTML, as well as a general overview of
the entire API, and a short tutorial for using the Genex classes. Each
module also includes a set of automated regression tests which allows
testing of the entire system before installation, which provide
further details of how to use the Genex.pm API. See the main <A
HREF="index.html">index</A> for more details.
