  <comment type="definition">This controlled
vocabulary describes what type of data is stored in the AM_Spots table
for this AM. The two major classifications are 'primary' and 'derived'
and each of those has further sub-classifications.

<term name="primary_raw"
        description="the unmodified numbers directly from the instrument"/>
<term name="derived_other"
        description="an AM derived mathematically from other primary
measurements, that are not replicate averages or ratios"/>
<term name="derived_ratio"
        description="a ratio of two values is reported, between the
averaged values of treatment replicates and the averaged value of
control replicates for the Treatment that reference this AM as its
derived ratio AM"/> 
<term name="derived_averaged_replicate"
        description="an AM whose spot values have been computed by
averaging across the spot values for all 'background_corrected' AM's in
the same replicate grouping"/>
<term name="background"
        description="refers to an ArrayMeasurement that represents the
per-spot background (noise) values"/> 
<term name="background_corrected"
        description="the primary raw value has had the background subtracted"/>
<term name="primary_no_data"
        description="an AM that has no associated AMS rows but
contains the sample info. For data that has been submitted as a
derived averaged replicate"/>
