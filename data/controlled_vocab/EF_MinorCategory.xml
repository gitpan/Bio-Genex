<term name="array_replicate"
        description="multiple arrays are used with either the same or
different RNA samples"
        comment="methodological"
/>
<term name="experimental_replicate"
        description="entire experimental design was replicated"
        comment="methodological"
/>
<term name="spot_replicate"
        description="array has each sequence feature multiple times"
        comment="methodological"
/>
<term name="sample_replicate"
        description="different RNA samples were used on either the
same filter with a hyb-strip-rehyb or on a different filter"
        comment="methodological"
/>
<term name="sample_preparation"
        description="Different sample preparation methods were
used, so this is not a true replicate, but one could compare the
results as if it were a replicate."
        comment="methodological"
/>
<term name="time_series"
        description="the experimental parameter is time"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="heat"
        description="the experimental parameter is an increase in
temperature above the organism's normal range"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="cold"
        description="the experimental parameter is a decrease in
temperature below the organism's normal range"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="salt"
        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
the salt concentration outside the organism's normal range"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="water"
        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
the amount of water"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="light"
        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
the amount of light"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="nutrient"
        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
concentration of an important nutrient, such as glucose"
        comment="biological"
/>
<term name="chemical"
        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
concentration of an exogenous chemical. This differs from drug or
toxin in that the chemical is not directly harmful to the organism,
but modifies the expression pattern of the organism. It is different
from nutrient in that it is not required for the organism's survival."

concentration of a toxin, such as kanate"

        description="the experimental parameter is a change in
concentration of a drug, such as an antibiotic"
        comment="biological"
/>

observation"
        comment="biological"
/>

and it's symbiotic partner, such as a plant and it's associated
mycorrhizal fungus"
